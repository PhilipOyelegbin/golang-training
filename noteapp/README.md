# Go Note Application CLI

## 📝 Project Description

**Go Note Application** is a simple, lightweight, and local-first Command Line Interface (CLI) application built with Go (Golang) to help store, and retrieve users notes.

This project serves as an excellent starting point for Go beginners to solidify fundamental concepts such as:

- Go Modules and Packages: Understanding project structure and dependencies.

- Structs and Slices: Defining and managing custom data collections.

- Functions and Error Handling: Writing modular, robust, and idiomatic Go code.

- File I/O: Reading from and writing to the local file system.

- JSON Serialization/Deserialization: Persisting structured data to disk.

## ✨ Features

- Register User: Interactively add new user with a firstName, lastName, email, and password tags.

- User Login: Interactively login with a email, and password tags.

- Create Notes: Interactively add new notes with a title, and description tags.

- View Notes: Retrieve and display the full details of a specific user notes by user ID.

- Delete Note: Remove a note from your vault using its ID.

- Local Persistence: All notes and users are saved to a local JSON file, ensuring your data is available across sessions.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies Used

- Go (Golang): The primary programming language.

- Standard Library Packages:

  - fmt: For formatted input and output.

  - os: For operating system interactions, including file system operations.

  - strings: For string manipulation (e.g., trimming, splitting, case conversion).

  - encoding/json: For marshaling (saving) and unmarshaling (loading) Go structs to/from JSON.

## 🚀 Installation

To get Go Note Application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Go is Installed:
   Make sure you have Go installed (version 1.18 or higher is recommended). You can download it from go.dev/dl/.
   Verify your installation:

```
go version
```

2. Clone the Repository (or create project manually):
   If you're starting from scratch as part of a learning exercise, you'd create the project structure manually as described in the task instructions. If this were a real repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/philipoyelegbin/golang-training.git/noteapp
cd noteApp
```

3. Initialize Go Module (if not already done):

```
go mod init github.com/philipoyelegbin/golang-training.git/noteapp # Only if you created the project manually
```

4. Build the Executable:
   This command compiles your Go source code into a single executable binary.

```
go build -o noteapp
```

This will create an executable file named noteapp in your project's root directory.

## 💡 Usage

Once built, you can run the CLI commands from your terminal.

**General Usage**

```
./noteapp     # Prompt you interactively to select an action to perform
```

**Commands**

This command will prompt you interactively

1. `1` - Register a new user

2. `2` - Create a new note

3. `3` - View your notes

4. `4` - Delete a notes

5. `5` - Exit the app

File Breakdown:

- `main.go`:

  - Contains the main function, which is the entry point of the application.

  - Includes some helper functions to load users from file, load notes from file, and action selector.

  - Includes some global variables

  - Orchestrates calls to the external functions.

- `functions/users.go`:

  - Contains functions to perform certain tasks like;

    - generate a user id for new user

    - validate user input for creating new user and login

    - save a new user to file

    - creating a new user

    - log in as a user

- `functions/notes.go`:

  - Contains functions to perform certain tasks like;

    - generate a note id for newly created note

    - validate note creation input

    - save a new note to file

    - creating a new note

    - viewing all notes for a logged in user

    - delete a note by id for a logged in user

- `schema/model.go`:

  - Contains the user and note type/model

## 💾 Data Persistence

All your code users and notes are stored locally in a users.json and notes.json file respoectively which are located in the db/ directory within your project.

- When the CLI starts, users.json and notes.json is loaded into memory.

- Any add or delete operations modify the in-memory data.

- After a modification, the function to save is called to write the updated data back to respective file, ensuring your changes are persistent.
